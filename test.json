  text: ### Executive Summary
Most original prompts suffer from extreme brevity or complete incoherence, with meaningful improvements achieved through role definition, task specification, and structured formatting.

### Common Mistakes & Patterns
**Recurring mistakes in original prompts:**
• Gibberish/random keystrokes ("asldkfjaslkdfjlasdjf", "alskjdfklda") appearing in 33% of entries
• Minimal effort greetings ("hi", "hi there") with no context or purpose
• Missing role definitions and task specifications
• Raw code dumps without clear instructions for analysis
• Informal language mixed with technical requests ("thx", "Love you pookie :3")

**Common patterns in successful improvements:**
• Adding explicit role definitions ("You are a..." statements)
• Breaking down tasks into numbered steps or clear sections
• Specifying expected output format and structure
• Including relevant context and background information
• Maintaining professional tone while preserving technical requirements

### Developer Tips
• Always start prompts with a clear role definition
• Replace vague requests with specific, measurable objectives
• Structure complex tasks using numbered lists or bullet points
• Include expected output format to guide AI responses
• Remove informal language and focus on professional clarity
• For code analysis, specify the programming language and scope explicitly
